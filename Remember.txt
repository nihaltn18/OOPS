In any inheritance -->
    Parent class object can access only it's class's data
    Child class object can access both it's class's and parent's class's data
    Parents class pointers can point to (or hold the address of) both it's class's object as well as it's child class's object
        -->when parent class pointer points to parent class object, then all the data mambers can be accessed by the pointer
        -->when parent class pointer points to child class objects, then pointer can access only those methods and variables which are common to both parent and child class:
            --->with the use of virtual keyword --> member variable and methods of parent class will be accessable and calld respectvely
            --->without the use of virtual keyword --> member variables and methods of the child class will be accessable and called respectively
    Child class pointer on other hand can point to(or hold the address of) only its class's object but can't point to(or hold the address of) parent's class's object


access specifiers-->
        -->public
        -->private
        -->protected
    Syntax-->
        class demo
        {
        public:
            //some code
        private:
            //some code
        protected:
            //some code
        //order of writing the blocks doesn't matter
        }
    private--> member variables and member functions are available to use only in that particular class, friend function and friend class
    protected--> member variables and member functions are available to only that particular class, direct subclass, friend function and friend class
    public--> member variables and member functions are available everywhere


Friend function and friend class-->
    Syntax-->
         class demo
         {
          //some code
          friend returntype function_name(arguments);
          friend class class_name;
          //above class and above function can access any of the member methods and member variables using the demo class object
         }


Inheritance access specifiers-->
    Syntax-->
        class class_name:access_specifier class_name, access_specifier class_name, access_specifier class_name........ 
        {
            //some code
        }
    Note-->
        public-->public goes to public and protected goes to protected
        protected-->both public and protected goes to protected
        private-->both public and protected goes to private
        private data members arr nevrr inherited

templates in C++-->
	it is like a general body which takes multiple general data types
	--> for functions -->
		template <typename T1, Template T2, Template T3.....>
		return_type function_name(args)
		{
			some codes.......
		}
			
			--OR--
		
		template <class T1, class T2, class T3........>
		return_type function_name(args)
		{
			some codes.......
		}
		
	--> for class -->
		template <typename T1, typename T2, typename T3.....>
		class A:public B<T1>,Private C<T2>......
		{
			some code........
		}	

			--OR--

		
		template <class T1, class T2, class T3.....>
		class A:public B<T1>,Private C<T2>......
		{
			some code........
		}
	 
	--> while calling 
		--> for functions --> variable_name = function_name<data_type1,data_type2<data_type3....>(args);
		--> for objects of the class --> class_name<data_type1,data_type2<data_type3....> object_name(args);
					     -->class_name<data_type1,data_type2<data_type3....> object_name = new class_name<data_type1,data_type2<data_type3....>(args);	
	-->NOTE--> we can replace T by any other name also
